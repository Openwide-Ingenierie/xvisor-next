	Xvisor on Sabre LITE (or Nitrogen6X) using SD Booting

This section of readme explains how to build & run Xvisor on real hardware
Sabre LITE using SD booting feature Boundary Devices preconfigured U-Boot.

TODO: guests have not been tested yet.

We need to add 2 images in boot partition of SD card that is shipped with
Sabre LITE:
 1) U-Boot compatible Xvisor binary (uvmm.bin).
 2) Boot script used by Boundary's U-Boot configuration (6x_bootscript)

Following steps to create these images and then boot Xvisor on Sabre LITE:

  [1. Build environment]
  # CROSS_COMPILE=arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi-
  # export CROSS_COMPILE
  Also place your compiler in PATH.

  [2. GoTo Xvisor source directory]
  # cd <xvisor_source_directory>

  [3. Configure Xvisor with Sabre LITE (or Nitrogen6X) host default settings]
  # make ARCH=arm sabrelite-defconfig

  [4. Build Xvisor and DTBs]
  # make; make dtbs

  [5. Make U-Boot compatible uvmm.bin for use with bootm command]
  # mkimage -A arm -O linux -T kernel -C none -a 0x17800000 -e 0x17800000 -n Xvisor -d build/vmm.bin build/uvmm.bin

  [6. Make the script to boot the card as preconfigured U-Boot expect]
  # mkimage -A arm -O linux -T script -C none -a 0 -e 0 -n "boot script" -d arch/arm/board/common/imx/6x_bootscript-sabrelite build/6x_bootscript

  [8. Unplug SD card from Sabre LITE and plug it on your development machine]

  [9. Mount boot partition (or partition 0) of SD card on your development machine]

  [10. Copy uvmm.bin to boot partition of SD card]
  # cp -f build/uvmm.bin <path_to_mounted_boot_partition_of_sd_card>

  [11. Copy and rename the device tree to boot partition of SD card]
  # cp -f build/arch/arm/board/generic/dts/imx6/sabrelite/one_guest_vexpress-a9.dtb <path_to_mounted_boot_partition_of_sd_card>/vmm-imx6q-sabrelite.dtb
  OR on Nitrogen6X:
  # cp -f build/arch/arm/board/generic/dts/imx6/sabrelite/one_guest_vexpress-a9.dtb <path_to_mounted_boot_partition_of_sd_card>/vmm-imx6q-nitrogen6x.dtb

  [12. Copy the boot script to boot partition of SD card]
  # cp -f build/6x_bootscript <path_to_mounted_boot_partition_of_sd_card>

  [13. Unmount boot partition (or partition 0) of SD card from your development machine]

  [14. Unplug SD card from your development machine and plug it back on Sabre LITE]

  [15. Connect to serial port of Sabre LITE using Putty or Minicom]

  [16. Power-up or Reset Sabre LITE]
